# DailyNews
This repo is a test project to produce a minimal news website using Python that is updated three times a day. 
The updating is automated with a Github Actions workflow. News articles are retrieved using NewsAPI, and the website format is built on the "blog" example from Bootstrap 5: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/.
